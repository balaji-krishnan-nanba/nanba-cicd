# Legacy CI/CD Configuration File
# 
# This file has been replaced by the new Databricks Asset Bundle CI/CD pipeline.
# 
# New structure:
# - Main workflow: devops/workflows/databricks-cicd.yml
# - Source code: src/
# - Documentation: devops/setup-instructions.md
#
# The new pipeline provides:
# - Databricks Asset Bundle integration
# - Multi-environment deployment (dev/test/prod)
# - Manual approval gates for test and production
# - Comprehensive testing at each stage
#
# Please refer to devops/setup-instructions.md for setup and usage instructions.
